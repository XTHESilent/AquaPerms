# Load AquaPerms before Vault. This means that all plugins that (soft-)depend
# on Vault depend on AquaPerms too.
#
# This fixes issues caused by plugins obtaining the Vault service provider instance
# only once when they initially enable. (if they haven't depended on LP, our registration
# won't be there yet)
loadbefore: [Vault]

# Soft depend on LilyPad for messaging service impl
# Soft depend on ViaVersion for adventure protocol facet
